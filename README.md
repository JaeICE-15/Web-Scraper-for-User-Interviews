# Wen-Scraper-for-User-Interviews
Simple python script that uses Selenium to scrape content from User Interviews and write the data into an excel spreadsheet

I decided to make this a thing after discovering User Interviews. After applying for multiple project listings with no results, I thought of different ways of how I could speed up/automate the process.

I might improve this program in the future, right now it doesn't do much.
